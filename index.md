### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was is still my favorite lab from the year. I liked lab 1 the most because it was the first lab I ever did and it tought me how to do the basic like push and clone. Lab 1 helped for the rest of the labs that came and as a Computer Science major it helped me get better at coding.


* Lab 7

    Lab 7 was also a favorite of mine because it delt with black jack. I enjoyed it because it expanded my knowledge on the game of black jack. I also enjoyed making the functions for the game.

* Lab 12

    Although lab 12 was difficult, it was one of my favorite labs. I liked lab 12 because I ejoyed the challege that it brought me. I enjoyed making my own gif with colors.
